1.The difference between absolute and relative positioning is the effect that other sections have upon the element that is either absolute or relative (in terms of positioning). An element with absolute positioning will not effect other elements and will not be effected by other elements. Absolute positioning will make the element in question operate outside the "flow" of the rest of the webpage. Relative positioning still operates with the flow of the webpage, but can be offset from either the browser border itself or from a parent container. A relative positioned element can be effected by elements above and below it in the flow of the webpage.

2. With the default box-sizing of elements the overall size of the box will be increased or decreased when the border or padding are changed, but adding border-box as a value to box-sizing will force the box to remain the same size even if the padding and border are changed. Increasing the size of the border or the padding will decreases the size of the content box in this case.
